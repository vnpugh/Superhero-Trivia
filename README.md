# Superhero Trivia :superhero_woman: :superhero_man:
I created a game with Java that quizzes players on superhero trivia. <br><br>
The Superheros: 
<ul>
<li>Wonder Woman</li>
<li>Superman</li>
<li>Batman</li>
</ul>
Overview
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>The game reads the superhero info from an input.txt file and stores it in an ArrayList.</li>
<li>Based on the player's answers, the game keeps track of every right and wrong answers.</li>
<li>If the number of right answers is greater than wrong answers, the player will see a winning message!</li>
<li>Next, FileWriter is used to write the player's name and results of the quiz in an output.txt file.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What was a win for me while completing this project?</strong> :trophy:I went back to the Java documentation to 
research BufferedReader/Writer, and then wrote out how I should approach the assignment. So, a win for me was being able
to put all the pieces together and understanding why each line of code is needed. I came across the FileWriter class
(for small writes) and started to read more about how this Java class can be implemented with the try/catch exceptions.
